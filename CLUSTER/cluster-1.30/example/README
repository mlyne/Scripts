The file example.c contains a small C program that calls the routines in the
C Clustering Library. To compile this program, type "make".

In addition to the C Clustering Library (cluster.c), the ranlib files ranlib.c,
com.c, and linpack.c are needed for random number generation. The ranlib files
are stored in the ranlib subdirectory; the ranlib library may also be already
present on your system.

If you want to call the routines in the C Clustering Library, in most cases the
file data.c is not needed. This file contains code to communicate between the
GUI program Cluster 3.0 and the routines in the C Clustering Library. For your
own program, you only need cluster.c, the ranlib files, and the corresponding
header files cluster.h and ranlib.h. See chapter 11 in the manual for more
information on compiling and linking the C Clustering Library.
