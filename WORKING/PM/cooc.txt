HIT: closed-loop in children with type 1 diabetes specific challenges to review challenges and opportunities related to closed-loop glucose control in children with type 1 diabetes t1d during closed-loop glucose control insulin infusion rates on a subcutaneous insulin pump are adjusted by a control algorithm according to subcutaneous glucose sensor readings a literature review is performed and personal experience of work with closed-loop systems at the university of cambridge uk is presented the main challenges in the management of t1d in children are identified together with a summary of current therapeutics options review of the literature recognises hypoglycaemia as a limiting factor for the attainment of optimal glycaemic control primarily in children additional specific confounding issues include unpredictable eating and exercise patterns especially in the youngest age group closed-loop systems might be particularly helpful but have to consider increased insulin sensitivity lower insulin doses and human factors such as size and usability of closed-loop components closed-loop systems may represent an alternative treatment option to achieve target glucose levels whilst reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia in children with t1d 
HIT: prevention and treatment of microvascular disease in childhood type 1 diabetes the incidence of type 1 diabetes t1d is increasing worldwide particularly in children and is associated with a significant burden mainly related to the development of vascular complications the prevention and treatment of microvascular complications which include nephropathy retinopathy and neuropathy are of paramount importance to decrease the associated mortality and morbidity a literature search was performed on medline and articles on microvascular complications with particular emphasis on the increasing incidence of childhood t1d and its implications on prevention and treatment of complications were selected the incidence of childhood t1d is increasing early identification of subjects at risk for long-term complications and early implementation of preventive and therapeutic strategies are fundamental in order to reduce the burden associated with microvascular complications of diabetes improving glycaemic control is the principle way of preventing and treating t1d complications in adults with t1d and microvascular complications treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs and statins is increasingly common whereas there are no definitive indications for treatment with these drugs in children and adolescents with early signs of complications there is growing interest in the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting specific pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of microvascular complications areas timely for developing research investigations to clarify genetic and environmental factors implicated in the pathogenesis of microvascular complications could lead to the identification of biochemical markers with high predictive values to be used as a guide for screening and intervention programmes 
HIT: glycaemic control and control of risk factors in diabetes patients in an ophthalmology clinic what lessons have we learned from the ukpds and dcct studies the diabetes control and complications trial dcct and uk prospective diabetes study ukpds have studied glycaemic control as well as other risk factors in preventing the progression of diabetic end-organ disease including diabetic retinopathy we wished to determine to what extent a cross-section of diabetes patients attending our eye clinic met the targets laid down by recent landmark studies we prospectively assessed 44 consecutive diabetes patients attending outpatient clinics for assessment of diabetic retinopathy each patient had hba1c levels serum cholesterol and blood pressure checked a proforma was completed for each patient of the 44 patients studied 11 had type 1 diabetes mellitus dm and 33 had type 2 dm 11 insulin-dependent dm iddm 22 non-insulin-dependent dm niddm the mean age of type 1 dm patients was 43 years that of type 2 dm patients was 62 years five of 11 46 type 1 dm patients had poorly controlled diabetes hba1c gt 9 compared with four of 33 12 type 2 dm patients overall 27 of 44 62 patients were on antihypertensive medication the prevalence of poorly controlled blood pressure gt 150 85 mmhg treated gt 160 90 mmhg untreated was 16 of 44 36 patients overall and was higher for type 2 dm patients 13 33 39 than for type 1 dm patients 3 11 27 random serum cholesterol levels gt 5 2 were found in 10 of 44 23 patients overall 4 11 36 type 1 and 6 33 18 type 2 dm patients control of hba1c hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia can slow progression of retinopathy and other dm end-points many of our patients were poorly controlled in terms of these risk factors more attention should be addressed to these primary preventative factors in the management of diabetes patients 
HIT: pro-oxidant challenge in vivo provokes the onset of niddm in the insulin resistant obese zucker rat we investigated the ability of an acute pro-oxidant challenge in vivo to deteriorate glycaemic control and insulin action in the obese zucker rat a model of insulin resistance associated with oxidant stress in obese animals the daily administration for 1 week of hydroquinone hq in combination with l-buthionine sulphoximine bso elevated fasting plasma glycaemia and insulinaemia and markedly aggravated i v glucose-stimulated hyperinsulinaemia without significantly affecting i v glucose tolerance suggesting exacerbated insulin resistance intermediate effects on hyperinsulinaemia in obese animals were determined with hq treatment alone while bso treatment alone had no effect in contrast none of the pro-oxidant treatments affected age-matched insulin sensitive lean zucker rats our data therefore demonstrate for the first time a vulnerability to deterioration in insulin action in an established insulin resistant state following an environmental pro-oxidative insult this may have relevance in the conversion of insulin resistance syndrome irs to non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus niddm 
HIT: insulin-like growth factor-i and diabetes a review although diabetes is a heterogeneous condition igf-i has been shown to improve glycaemic control and reduce insulin requirements in both iddm and niddm in iddm the therapeutic rationale for igf-i is as a replacement therapy quot topping up quot low circulating igf-i levels there is now convincing evidence that this is associated with a reduction in gh secretion resulting in an improvement in insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control the mechanism may simply be reduced gh-secretion but pre and post-receptor effects on insulin sensitivity are also likely it is not clear what effect igf-i treatment has on igf binding proteins but with the restoration of a more normal gh igf-i axis they are likely to be restored to normal concentrations which may in turn have a direct effect on glucose metabolism in niddm the mechanism of action of igf-i remains unclear at high doses igf-i may mimic insulin but at levels resulting in unacceptable quot acromegalic quot igf-i levels and side-effects the most exciting data concerning igf-i is with a low dose where igf-i improves insulin sensitivity by an unknown mechanism this may be mediated via the igf-i receptor by cross-reactivity with the insulin receptor or by activation of hybrid receptors the exact mechanism and interaction remains to be elucidated in severe insulin-resistant states igf-i-treatment appears to be effective and may be the only realistic therapeutic measure in the near future and warrants further investigation detailed genetic characterization of these syndromes following treatment with igf-i may also help to characterize the mechanism of action of igf-i and its interactions with the insulin receptor thus igf-i appears to have a future as a therapeutic agent in treating diabetes but long-term studies addressing safety and short-term studies addressing mechanisms are essential with only a few pharmaceutical companies having the capability to produce igf-i for scientific and therapeutic investigation it is important that short-term marketing strategy does not prevent the proper exploration of this exciting peptide hormone as a therapeutic agent for all types of diabetes 
HIT: metabolic effects of tibolone in postmenopausal women with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus postmenopausal women with non-insulin dependent diabetes niddm are frequently obese hypertensive and hyperlipidaemic and hence at particular risk of coronary heart disease chd they might therefore benefit from menopausal therapy in view of the improvement in insulin sensitivity and the reduction in triglyceride levels induced by tibolone in healthy postmenopausal women we evaluated the effects of 12 months of tibolone on glycaemic control serum insulin and lipid levels in postmenopausal women with niddm a prospective 12 months before after intervention study fourteen postmenopausal women mean age 58 14 + 1 25 years mean duration of menopause 121 21 + 13 42 months mean bmi 26 55 + 0 97 with niddm mean duration of diabetes 113 79 + 13 89 months fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were assessed monthly serum fructosamine fasting and postprandial insulin every 3 months and serum lipids total cholesterol triglyceride hdl-cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol every 6 months changes in blood glucose both fasting and postprandial were not statistically significant during the treatment period serum fructosamine concentration increased significantly after 9 months a significant decrease in fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations was observed after 9 months a non-significant decrease was observed in total cholesterol ldl cholesterol and triglyceride but no change in hdl cholesterol body weight did not change during the period of observation a slight deterioration in glycaemic control a fall in insulin concentration and no change in serum lipids were observed in women with niddm during 12 months treatment with tibolone 
HIT: niddm as a disease of the innate immune system association of acute-phase reactants and interleukin-6 with metabolic syndrome x non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus niddm is commonly associated with hypertriglyceridaemia low serum hdl-cholesterol concentrations hypertension obesity and accelerated atherosclerosis metabolic syndrome x since a similar dyslipidaemia occurs with the acute-phase response we investigated whether elevated acute-phase stress reactants the innate immune system s response to environmental stress and their major cytokine mediator interleukin-6 il-6 are associated with niddm and syndrome x and may thus provide a unifying pathophysiological mechanism for these conditions two groups of caucasian subjects with niddm were studied those with any 4 or 5 features of syndrome x n 19 were compared with a group with 0 or 1 feature of syndrome x n 25 but similar age sex distribution diabetes duration glycaemic control and diabetes treatment healthy non-diabetic subjects of comparable age and sex acted as controls overnight urinary albumin excretion rate a risk factor for cardiovascular disease was also assayed in subjects to assess its relationship to the acute-phase response serum sialic acid was confirmed as a marker of the acute-phase response since serum concentrations were significantly related to established acute-phase proteins such as alpha-1 acid glycoprotein r 0 82 p lt 0 0001 there was a significant graded increase of serum sialic acid alpha-1 acid glycoprotein il-6 and urinary albumin excretion rate amongst the three groups with the lowest levels in non-diabetic subjects intermediate levels in niddm patients without syndrome x and highest levels in niddm patients with syndrome x c-reactive protein and cortisol levels were also higher in syndrome x-positive compared to x-negative patients and serum amyloid a was higher in both diabetic groups than in the control group we conclude that niddm is associated with an elevated acute-phase response particularly in those with features of syndrome x abnormalities of the innate immune system may be a contributor to the hypertriglyceridaemia low hdl cholesterol hypertension glucose intolerance insulin resistance and accelerated atherosclerosis of niddm microalbuminuria may be a component of the acute-phase response 
HIT: altered ventricular repolarization during hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes there is circumstantial evidence implicating hypoglycaemia in the sudden overnight death of young patients with insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus iddm the mechanism of which is unknown we have investigated the effects of hypoglycaemia on the electrocardiogram in 15 patients with diabetes 8 with iddm and 7 with niddm using a high resolution computer-based system patients were randomized to either 2 h of euglycaemia or hypoglycaemia at around 3 mmol l 1 during the afternoon using hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamps the two visits separated by a period of at least 4 weeks corrected qt interval qtc plasma potassium and adrenaline were measured at baseline and at 0 60 and 120 min the degree of qtc lengthening from baseline during clamped hypoglycaemia was greater compared to the euglycaemic control period in patients with iddm median range at 60 min 156 8 to 258 vs 6 3 to 28 ms p lt 0 02 and niddm 120 min 128 16 to 166 vs 4 3 to 169 ms p lt 0 05 the fall in plasma potassium was greater during clamped hypoglycaemia compared to euglycaemia in those with niddm p lt 0 03 but not in those with iddm p gt 0 06 the rise in plasma adrenaline was greater during clamped hypoglycaemia in both groups iddm p lt 0 02 niddm p lt 0 02 and there was a strong relationship between the rise in adrenaline and increase in qtc r 0 73 p lt 0 0001 these data demonstrate alteration of ventricular repolarization with lengthening of the qt interval during hypoglycaemia and suggest a possible mechanism by which hypoglycaemia could cause ventricular arrhythmias 
HIT: insulin receptor substrate-1 gene polymorphism and cardiovascular risk in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and patients undergoing coronary angiography clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease related to insulin resistance may account for the increased incidence of vascular disease in these conditions and in non-diabetic subjects to investigate the relationship between a coding polymorphism in the insulin receptor substrate-1 gene and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors 209 patients with niddm and 452 subjects investigated for coronary artery disease cad were studied in the niddm subjects 22 10 5 were heterozygous at codon 972 for a polymorphism which codes for a glycine to arginine substitution and 187 89 5 were homozygous for the wild type patients with the mutation had lower levels of cholesterol compared with wild type mean 95 confidence intervals 5 3 4 9-5 8 vs 6 0 5 9-6 2 mmol l respectively p 0 002 triglyceride 1 7 1 4-2 1 vs 2 2 2 0-2 4 mmol l p 0 051 factor vii c activity 109 5 85 5-133 5 vs 133 5 127-140 p 0 057 and pai-1 antigen 16 0 10 5-24 3 vs 22 2 20 0-24 6 ng ml p 0 054 there were no differences in body mass index indices of glycaemic control fasting insulin or the prevalence of hypertension in patients with cad 55 12 7 were carriers of the mutation including three homozygotes niddm vs cad ns although similar trends in cholesterol factor vii pai-1 antigen and triglyceride existed between carriers of the mutation and the wild type none reached statistical significance the results indicate that the irs-1 gene is not implicated in the pathogenesis of niddm or cad 
HIT: glucagon-like peptide-1 glp-1 a trial of treatment in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus glucagon-like peptide-1 7-36 amide glp-1 is released from the gut into the circulation after meals and is the most potent physiological insulinotropic hormone in man in contrast to presently available therapeutic agents for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus niddm glp-1 has the advantages of both suppressing glucagon secretion and delaying gastric emptying we report the first chronic study of subcutaneous s c glp-1 treatment in niddm five patients with poorly controlled niddm were entered into a six-week double-blind crossover trial each received three weeks treatment with s c glp-1 40 nmol or saline given three times a day immediately before meals a standardized test meal was given at the beginning and end of each treatment period glp-1 reduced plasma glucose area under the curve auc following the standard test meal by 25 auc 0-180 mins glp-1 start of treatment 482 2 + 38 2 vs saline start of treatment 635 7 + 45 4 mmol min l-1 f 16 4 p lt 0 02 the beneficial effect of glp-1 on plasma glucose concentration was fully maintained for the three-week treatment period plasma glucagon levels were significantly lower for 60 min postprandially after glp-1 treatment in this group of patients there was no significant increase in postprandial insulin levels with glp-1 we have demonstrated a significant improvement in postprandial glycaemic control with s c glp-1 treatment that was fully maintained over a three-week treatment period glp-1 improves glycaemic control even in the absence of an insulinotropic effect and is a potential treatment for niddm 
HIT: effect of dietary fish oil supplementation on peroxidation of serum lipids in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus lipid peroxidation may be important in the development of cardiovascular disease a common cause of mortality and morbidity in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus niddm we assessed the degree of lipid peroxidation by measuring plasma malondialdehyde as thiobarbituric acid reacting substances tbars in 23 non-insulin diabetic patients plasma levels of standardised alpha-tocopherol vitamin e lipid content of whole plasma and lipoprotein fractions glycosylated haemoglobin glycosylated low density lipoprotein ldl and fasting blood glucose were also measured on completion of the baseline studies patients randomly received either fish oil or matching olive oil capsules in a double blind crossover fashion for 6 weeks followed by a 6 week washout period and a final 6 week treatment phase studies identical to the initial baseline studies were performed at the end of the of the active treatment periods at 6 and 18 weeks treatment with olive oil did not change levels of tbars vitamin e or indices of glycaemic control compared with baseline total cholesterol and triglyceride tg content of plasma and lipoprotein fractions were not significantly altered treatment with fish oil resulted in elevation of tbars p lt 0 001 and reduction of vitamin e p lt 0 01 compared with baseline and olive oil treatment plasma cholesterol was unchanged a reduction in plasma tg compared with baseline occurred but failed to reach significance p 0 07 changes in apo b containing lipoproteins induced by fish oil failed to reach significance no significant changes were observed in concentration or composition of high density lipoprotein hdl fish oil treatment showed no change in glycaemic control as assessed by glycosylated haemoglobin and ldl although a rise in fasting blood glucose just failed to reach significance p 0 06 lipid peroxidation in niddm can be exacerbated by dietary fish oil this potentially adverse reaction may limit the therapeutic use of fish oils in such patients 
HIT: variant sequences of the hexokinase ii gene in familial niddm hexokinase ii hkii plays a central role in the intracellular metabolism of glucose in skeletal muscle catalysing the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate it is therefore considered to be a potentially important candidate gene in the development of insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus niddm the aim of this study was to screen the hkii gene for mutations in niddm subjects from insulin-resistant families insulin sensitivity was assessed in unaffected first degree relatives from families with two or more living niddm subjects and 15 families were identified as being insulin resistant in 15 niddm subjects one from each family and 4 normoglycaemic control subjects all 18 exons of the hkii gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and the products screened for mutations using a combination of single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing six sequence variations were detected in the niddm subjects four silent polymorphisms gat vs gac at codon 251 in exon 7 aat vs aac at codon 692 in exon 15 ccg vs ccc at codon 736 in exon 15 and ctg vs cta at codon 766 in exon 16 a single base change t- gt c 22 base pairs distal to the exon-intron junction of exon 17 in the 5 splice donor and a single amino acid substitution gln142- gt his in exon 4 which was identified in 6 of the 15 niddm subjects the frequency of the mutated codon 142 allele however was comparable between niddm subjects with familial niddm n 56 and normoglycaemic control subjects n 48 18 8 and 14 6 for niddm subjects and control subjects respectively chi 2 0 6 p gt 0 25 in addition measures of insulin sensitivity were comparable in normal glucose tolerant subjects with n 20 and without n 40 the codon 142 polymorphism in conclusion 1 mutations in the coding regions of the hkii gene are unlikely to be major determinants in the development of insulin resistance and familial niddm although 2 the influence of the codon 142 mutation in combination with other abnormalities of the insulin-signalling pathway on insulin action remain to be addressed 
HIT: glycated haemoglobin levels in patients with diabetes in one general practice over a 10-year period the aim of the study was to evaluate the level of control as reflected by hba1c in patients with diabetes attending one general practice over a 10-year period the study was based in one general practice in south tyneside uk and consisted of an analysis of hba1c values of all patients with diabetes attending the practice between 1983 andhba1c levels were analysed and are presented as multiples of the standard deviation above the mean in the practice 256 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus niddm and 76 with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus iddm attended for a total of 1596 doctor patient contacts in the diabetic clinic over 10 years the prevalence of diabetes was 1 9 over the course of the clinic in any one year 25 of patients with niddm and 55 with iddm had levels of hba1c above those thought to be associated with increased risk of microvascular complications significant reduction in glycated haemoglobin hba1c occurred in the first year after diagnosis p lt 0 01 and after changing treatment from diet alone to diet and oral hypoglycaemic agents p lt 0 001 we conclude that a large proportion of patients within this population had levels of glycaemic control that put them at increased risk

HIT: the effects of oral hypoglycaemic drugs on serum lipids and lipoproteins in non-insulin-dependent diabetes niddm coronary heart disease is a major cause of morbidity in niddm and is likely to be related to the abnormalities in serum lipids and lipoproteins commonly associated with it the effects of treatment in general and of oral hypoglycaemic drugs in particular on serum lipids in niddm are not clear in a cross-over study the effects of 3 months treatment with metformin glibenclamide on body weight blood glucose control and serum lipoproteins were compared in 35 patients with niddm inadequately controlled by diet alone glibenclamide alone increased body weight glibenclamide and metformin achieved equivalent blood glucose control independent of initial body mass index neither drug affected serum triglyceride metformin significantly reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol mean change 0 34 mmol 1 95 confidence intervals 0 12 to 0 57 mmol l p less than 0 01 neither drug altered high density lipoprotein or subfraction cholesterol changes in serum lipoproteins were also studied in 14 patients with niddm on long term metformin therapy after 6 weeks placebo and again 6 weeks after restarting active drug therapy withdrawal of metformin resulted in a rise in fasting blood glucose hba1 serum total and low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol restarting the drug reversed these changes multivariate analysis showed that serum total and ldl cholesterol varied with treatment but not with glycaemic control metformin can therefore lower total and ldl cholesterol in niddm and this effect appears to be maintained long term 
HIT: alpha-blocker therapy a possible advance in the treatment of diabetic hypertension--results of a cross-over study of doxazosin and atenolol monotherapy in hypertensive non-insulin dependent diabetic subjects hyperglycaemia a raised fibrinogen an increased serum triglyceride and a reduced hdl-cholesterol are common metabolic features of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus niddm hypertension is frequently associated with niddm however the influence of antihypertensive therapy on these combined factors in the diabetic is at present unclear in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 20 stable niddm subjects with hypertension the metabolic effects of 6 weeks treatment with the alpha-blocker doxazosin was compared with treatment with the beta-blocker atenolol similar and significant reductions in bp were produced by both drugs significant increases in weight hba1 apoprotein b serum triglyceride and cholesterol hdl ratio were observed with atenolol therapy doxazosin therapy was associated with opposite patterns of changes in fasting glucose lipids and lipoproteins but only for serum triglyceride was difference between treatments significant fibrinogen was not altered by either treatment conclusions from this study indicate 1 adrenergic mechanisms may be an important influence on glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism in niddm and 2 the beta-blocker atenolol has a small adverse effect on weight glycaemic control and the atherogenic lipid profile whereas the alpha-blocker doxazosin has no such effect and may in part correct the disturbances of lipoprotein metabolism characteristic of niddm
