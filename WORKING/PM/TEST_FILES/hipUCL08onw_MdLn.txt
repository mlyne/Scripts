TI  - Preoperative Radiographic Assessment of Limb-length Discrepancy in Total Hip
      Arthroplasty.
PG  - 1677-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic radiographs are helpful in assessing limb-length discrepancy
      (LLD) before and after THA but are subject to variation. Different methods are
      used to determine LLDs. As a pelvic reference, both ischial tuberosities and the 
      teardrops are used, and as a femoral reference, the lesser trochanter and center 
      of the femoral head are used. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We validated the different
      methods for preoperative radiographic measurement of LLDs and evaluated their
      reliability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: LLDs were measured on full-leg radiographs for
      52 patients (29 men, 23 women) with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and compared
      with different methods for measuring LLDs on AP radiographs of the pelvis.
      RESULTS: The true LLD varied from -8.0 to 9.1 mm. When the biischial line was
      used as a pelvic reference, the LLD measured on AP pelvis radiographs was
      different from the true LLD. No difference was found when the interteardrop line 
      was used as a pelvic reference. There was substantial interobserver agreement
      when the lesser trochanter was used as a femoral reference (kappa = 0.66-0.70)
      and excellent interobserver and intraobserver agreement for all other
      measurements (kappa = 0.84-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show use of the biischial
      line as a pelvic reference should be discouraged and the interteardrop line is a 
      better alternative. The center of the femoral head is a more reliable femoral
      landmark compared with the lesser trochanter. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I,
      diagnostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels
      of evidence.

TI  - Hip arthroscopy: analysis of a single surgeon's learning experience.
PG  - 52-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to objectively quantify a surgeon's
      learning experience for hip arthroscopy. METHODS: We prospectively reviewed the
      first 100 hip arthroscopic procedures performed between 1999 and 2004 by a single
      experienced consultant orthopaedic surgeon. In the second part of the study,
      three groups of patients were sequentially analyzed: Group 1 included the first
      thirty patients treated by the surgeon; group 2, the sixty-first through
      ninetieth patients; and group 3, the 121st through 150th patients. The groups
      were compared with regard to the diagnosis, the duration of the central and
      peripheral compartment procedure, patient satisfaction, conversion to
      arthroplasty, and the nonarthritic hip score. RESULTS: There was a decrease in
      complications from the first thirty cases to the remaining seventy operations.
      There was an overall decrease in operative time over the 100 cases, representing 
      a gradual learning process. A marked decrease in the operative time for central
      compartment arthroscopy was noted when we compared group 1 (mean, seventy
      minutes; range, forty-five to ninety-eight minutes), group 2 (mean, forty-eight
      minutes; range, twenty-six to fifty-nine minutes), and group 3 (mean,
      thirty-seven minutes; range, eighteen to sixty-one minutes). The operative time
      for peripheral compartment arthroscopy also decreased from group 2 (mean,
      ninety-one minutes; range, sixty to 126 minutes) to group 3 (mean, forty-five
      minutes; range, thirty-six to sixty-two minutes). There was an overall decrease
      in operative time over the first 100 cases. No difference among groups was noted 
      in the number of cases requiring a reoperation or conversion to arthroplasty.
      There was a higher complication rate in the first thirty cases. An increase in
      the nonarthritic hip scores was noted postoperatively in the two groups in which 
      the preoperative score had been measured. The postoperative score improved from
      group 1 (mean, 69; range, 39 to 84) to group 2 (mean, 79; range, 58 to 92) to
      group 3 (mean, 86; range, 51 to 98). Patient satisfaction was highest in group 3.
      CONCLUSIONS: Hip arthroscopy is associated with high patient satisfaction and
      good short-term outcomes, but there is a learning curve that we estimate to be
      approximately thirty cases.

TI  - Body mass index, waist circumference and waist-hip ratio: which is the better
      discriminator of cardiovascular disease mortality risk? Evidence from an
      individual-participant meta-analysis of 82 864 participants from nine cohort
      studies.

AB  - Few studies have examined both the relative magnitude of association and the
      discriminative capability of multiple indicators of obesity with cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) mortality risk. We conducted an individual-participant
      meta-analysis of nine cohort studies of men and women drawn from the British
      general population resulting in sample of 82 864 individuals. Body mass index
      (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were measured
      directly. There were 6641 deaths (1998 CVD) during a mean of 8.1 years of
      follow-up. After adjustment, a one SD higher in WHR and WC was related to a
      higher risk of CVD mortality (hazard ratio [95% CI]): 1.15 (1.05-1.25) and 1.15
      (1.04-1.27), respectively. The risk of CVD mortality also increased linearly
      across quintiles of both these abdominal obesity markers with a 66% increased
      risk in the highest quintile of WHR. In age- and sex-adjusted models only, BMI
      was related to CVD mortality but not in any other analyses. No major differences 
      were revealed in the discrimination capabilities of models with BMI, WC or WHR
      for cardiovascular or total mortality outcomes. In conclusion, measures of
      abdominal adiposity, but not BMI, were related to an increased risk of CVD
      mortality. No difference was observed in discrimination capacities between
      adiposity markers.

TI  - Stress and adiposity: a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.
PG  - 771-8
AB  - Psychosocial stress has been strongly implicated in the biology of adiposity but 
      epidemiological studies have produced inconsistent results. The aim of this
      analysis was to bring together results from published, longitudinal, prospective 
      studies examining associations between psychosocial stress and objectively
      measured adiposity in a meta-analysis. Searches were conducted on Medline,
      PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed (to January 2009) and reference lists from
      relevant articles were examined. Prospective studies relating psychosocial stress
      (general life stress (including caregiver stress), work stress) to BMI, body fat,
      body weight, waist circumference, or waist-to-hip ratio were included. Analyses
      from 14 cohorts were collated and evaluated. There was no significant
      heterogeneity, no evidence of publication bias, and no association between study 
      quality and outcomes. The majority of analyses found no significant relationship 
      between stress and adiposity (69%), but among those with significant effects,
      more found positive than negative associations (25 vs. 6%). Combining results in 
      a meta-analysis showed that stress was associated with increasing adiposity (r = 
      0.014; confidence interval (CI) = 0.002-0.025, P < 0.05). Effects were stronger
      for men than women, in analyses with longer rather than shorter follow-ups, and
      in better quality studies. We conclude that psychosocial stress is a risk factor 
      for weight gain but effects are very small. Variability across studies indicates 
      there are moderating variables to be elucidated.

PG  - 129-135
LID - 10.5301/HIP.2011.6504 [doi]
AB  - Abstract. This is a medium-term, prospective assessment of 56 revision total hip 
      replacements using a.cementless, extensively porous-coated femoral stem.with a
      mean follow-up of 6 years. All implants demonstrated evidence of bony ingrowth
      and stable fixation with no cases of loosening, instability, deep infection,
      stress shielding, subsidence or osteolysis at last follow-up. Complications
      included two intra-operative fractures, three dislocations, one superficial
      infection, and one patient with thigh pain. No femoral stems were revised. Good
      to excellent clinical outcomes were achieved on Harris Hip Score (90% (n =
      47/52), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (92% (n = 48/52), and
      University of California Los Angeles activity score (96% (n=50/52). This supports
      the use of this system in the revision hip surgery armamentarium.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of tranexamic acid in total hip
      replacement.
PG  - 39-46
AB  - We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomised
      controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing
      blood loss and transfusion in total hip replacement (THR). The data were
      evaluated using the generic evaluation tool designed by the Cochrane Bone, Joint 
      and Muscle Trauma Group. We identified 11 clinical trials which were suitable for
      detailed extraction of data. There were no trials that used TXA in revision THR. 
      A total of seven studies (comprising 350 patients) were eligible for the blood
      loss outcome data. The use of TXA reduced intra-operative blood loss by a mean of
      104 ml (95% confidence interval (CI) -164 to -44, p = 0.0006, heterogeneity I(2) 
      0%), postoperative blood loss by a mean of 172 ml (95% CI -263 to -81, p =
      0.0002, heterogeneity I(2) 63%) and total blood loss by a mean of 289 ml (95% CI 
      -440 to -138, p < 0.0002, heterogeneity I(2) 54%). TXA led to a significant
      reduction in the proportion of patients requiring allogeneic blood transfusion
      (risk difference -0.20, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.11, p < 0.00001, I(2) 15%). There were
      no significant differences in deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, infection
      rates or other complications among the study groups.

TI  - Ethnic and gender differences in the relationship between hostility and metabolic
      and autonomic risk factors for coronary heart disease.
PG  - 53-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between hostility and biological risk
      factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) in a population of white European and
      South Asian men and women living in the United Kingdom. METHODS: This
      cross-sectional study involved a community-based sample of 1,757 healthy white
      and South Asian men and women aged between 35 years and 75 years from West
      London. Participants completed the Cook-Medley Hostility Scale, together with
      measures of standard biological risk factors and heart rate variability.
      Associations between hostility and CHD risk factors were evaluated, controlling
      for age, education, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, and waist/hip
      ratio, using regression models. RESULTS: In white men, hostility was associated
      positively with fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and negatively with
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. High levels of hostility were also related 
      to increased prevalence of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome in white men.
      Hostility in South Asian men was associated with impaired autonomic function.
      Hostility was not related to any biological CHD risk factors in South Asian or
      white women. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that hostility was independently
      associated with glucose metabolism and dyslipidemia in white men, and with
      autonomic dysfunction in South Asian men. Hostility was found not to be relevant 
      for measured CHD risk factors in females. Longitudinal data are required to
      establish whether the impact of hostility on CHD risk in men is mediated through 
      metabolic and autonomic processes.

      treatment. This study aimed to: (i) assess the impact of hip/knee replacement
      surgery on ex vivo thrombin generation (TG), prothrombin fragments 1 + 2 (F1 +
      2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) and D-dimer; (ii) compare the
      anticoagulant effects of dalteparin and rivaroxaban on TG 24 h after surgery.
      Haemostatic variables were assessed in plasma samples of 51 patients taken
      pre-operatively, peri-operatively, and 24 h post-operatively. Prophylaxis, once a
      day, with dalteparin or rivaroxaban, starting 6-8 h post-operatively, was
      administered in 25 (14 knee/11 hip) and 26 patients (13 knee/13 hip)
      respectively. TG, F1 + 2, TAT and D-dimer increased during surgery. Dalteparin
      patients showed a variable TG response 24 h after surgery: conversely, the effect
      of rivaroxaban on TG was consistent across individuals. Good correlation was seen
      between rivaroxaban levels and TG-lag-time (rs = 0.46, P = 0.01); TG-time-to-Peak
      (rs = 0.53, P = 0.005); TG-peak-thrombin (rs = -0.59, P = 0.001); and
      TG-velocity-index-rate (rs = -0.61, P = 0.0009). Patients who received
      rivaroxaban showed a greater decrease of TG, F1 + 2 and TAT (but not D-dimer)
      than those on dalteparin. TG increases during hip/knee replacement surgery.
      Rivaroxaban inhibits TG more than dalteparin at 24 h after surgery.

TI  - Religious and ethnic differences in health: evidence from the Health Surveys for 
      England 1999 and 2004.
PG  - 549-68
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the role of religion in the patterning of health
      inequities, and how this is related to ethnicity and socioeconomic status.
      DESIGN: Multivariate analyses using nationally representative data on
      self-assessed fair or poor health, longstanding limiting illness, diagnosed
      diabetes, diagnosed hypertension, waist-hip ratio, body mass index, current
      tobacco use and participating in no regular physical activity from 14,924
      Christians, 4337 Muslims, 656 Sikhs, 1197 Hindus and 2682 people reporting not
      identifying with any religion with different ethnic backgrounds, who were
      interviewed as part of the Health Survey for England in either 1999 or 2004,
      adjusted for age, gender and socioeconomic status and periodicity. RESULTS: Odds 
      ratios for general health, hypertension, diabetes, waist-hip ratio, tobacco use
      and physical activity speak to the importance of ethnicity in the patterning of
      health inequalities. But there is also evidence of an important, independent role
      for religion, with risks for the different health indicators varying between
      people with the same ethnic, but different religious, identifications. Adjusting 
      for socioeconomic status attenuated the ethnic/religious patterning of,
      particularly, self-assessed health, longstanding activity-limiting illness,
      waist-hip ratio, body mass index and tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS: This evidence
      enables greater understanding of the complexities of the relationship between
      ethnicity, religion and health, recognising the need to understand the
      heterogeneity underlying both ethnic and religious group membership and the
      processes producing the structural disadvantage facing certain religious and
      ethnic groups in the mediation of the relationship between health and
      ethnicity/religion.

TI  - Explaining variation in referral from primary to secondary care: cohort study.
PG  - c6267
LID - 10.1136/bmj.c6267 [doi]
LID - bmj.c6267 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent to which referral for defined symptoms from
      primary care varies by age, sex, and social deprivation and whether any
      sociodemographic variations in referral differ according to the presence of
      national referral guidance and the potential of the symptoms to be life
      threatening. DESIGN: Cohort study using individual patient data from the health
      improvement network database in primary care. SETTING: United Kingdom.
      PARTICIPANTS: 5492 patients with postmenopausal bleeding, 23 121 with hip pain,
      and 101 212 with dyspepsia from 326 general practices, 2001-7. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Multivariable associations between odds of immediate referral for
      postmenopausal bleeding and age and social deprivation; hazard rates of referral 
      for hip pain or dyspepsia and age, sex, and social deprivation. Analyses for
      dyspepsia were stratified for people aged less than and more than 55 years
      because referral guidance differs by age. RESULTS: 61.4% (3374/5492) of patients 
      with postmenopausal bleeding, 17.4% (4019/23 121) with hip pain, and 13.8% (13
      944/101 212) with dyspepsia were referred. The likelihood of referral for
      postmenopausal bleeding declined with increasing age: the adjusted odds ratio for
      patients aged 85 or more compared with those aged 55-64 was 0.39 (95% confidence 
      interval 0.31 to 0.49). Patients aged 85 or more with hip pain were also less
      likely to be referred than those aged 55-64 (0.68, 0.57 to 0.81). Women were less
      likely than men to be referred for hip pain (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence
      interval 0.84 to 0.96). More deprived patients with hip pain or dyspepsia (if
      aged <55) were less likely to be referred. Adjusted hazard ratios for those in
      the most deprived Townsend fifth compared with the least deprived were 0.72 (95% 
      confidence interval 0.62 to 0.82) and 0.76 (0.68 to 0.85), respectively. No
      socioeconomic gradient was evident in referral for postmenopausal bleeding.
      CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in referral associated with socioeconomic circumstances
      were more likely to occur in the absence of both explicit guidance and
      potentially life threatening conditions, whereas inequalities with age were
      evident for all conditions.

TI  - Anterior approaches to the hip for the treatment of femoro-acetabular
      impingement: a cadaveric study.
PG  - 482-8
AB  - Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) may be a cause of early osteoarthritis of the 
      hip. The aim of surgical treatment is to improve the head-neck offset in the
      presence of a cam lesion and to perform acetabular rim resection when pincer
      impingement is evident, either by open surgery or arthroscopically. We
      investigated two mini anterior approaches to the hip joint based on the Heuter
      and direct anterior approach to assess their potential for treating FAI. The two 
      approaches were employed in 20 hips in 10 human cadaveric specimens. The area of 
      femoral head and the portion of the acetabular rim that could be exposed was
      documented. We found that the two approaches were easy and reproducible. Both
      allowed adequate exposure to the femoral head. The area of acetabular rim
      accessible varied significantly according to the approach (p<0.05). We also found
      that the position of the anterior inferior iliac spine in relation to the
      acetabular rim also affected the area of acetabular rim exposed (p<0.05). In
      summary, cam and pincer impingement of the hip can be treated by either the
      direct anterior or by the Heuter approach. The choice of approach is dictated by 
      the site of the acetabular pincer lesion identified on pre-operative imaging,
      with a more medial exposure possible through the direct anterior approach and
      more anterolateral exposure via the Heuter approach.

PG  - 418-26
AB  - Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) are among the more difficult and expensive
      complications of total hip arthroplasty. A rise in the elderly population and
      increase use of primary hip replacement has led to an escalating incidence. They 
      can occur intra operatively and post operatively. The treatment algorithm defined
      by the Vancouver classification has universal acceptance. The epidemiology,
      etiology, classification and the management of periprosthetic femoral fractures
      in total hip arthroplasty are reviewed.

TI  - Modification of the explant system for the removal of well fixed hip resurfacing 
      sockets.
PG  - 1170.e7-9
AB  - A major concern during revision hip arthroplasty is acetabular bone loss during
      the extraction of well-fixed acetabular components. Despite the good early
      survivorship of resurfacing prostheses, revision surgery may be necessary. We
      recommend the use of the Explant acetabular extraction system (Zimmer, Warsaw,
      Ind) with a trial liner to preserve acetabular bone stock. We present 2 cases of 
      revised resurfacings using this technique, demonstrating minimal interference to 
      the remaining acetabular bone.

TI  - Survival in critical illness is associated with early activation of mitochondrial
      biogenesis.
PG  - 745-51
AB  - RATIONALE: We previously reported outcome-associated decreases in muscle
      energetic status and mitochondrial dysfunction in septic patients with multiorgan
      failure. We postulate that survivors have a greater ability to maintain or
      recover normal mitochondrial functionality. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether
      mitochondrial biogenesis, the process promoting mitochondrial capacity, is
      affected in critically ill patients. METHODS: Muscle biopsies were taken from 16 
      critically ill patients recently admitted to intensive care (average 1-2 d) and
      from 10 healthy, age-matched patients undergoing elective hip surgery.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Survival, mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial 
      protein content and enzyme activity, mitochondrial biogenesis factor mRNA,
      microarray analysis, and phosphorylated (energy) metabolites were determined. Ten
      of 16 critically ill patients survived intensive care. Mitochondrial size
      increased with worsening outcome, suggestive of swelling. Respiratory protein
      subunits and transcripts were depleted in critically ill patients and to a
      greater extent in nonsurvivors. The mRNA content of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (transcriptional
      coactivator of mitochondrial biogenesis) was only elevated in survivors, as was
      the mitochondrial oxidative stress protein manganese superoxide dismutase.
      Eventual survivors demonstrated elevated muscle ATP and a decreased
      phosphocreatine/ATP ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Eventual survivors responded early to
      critical illness with mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defense responses.
      These responses may partially counteract mitochondrial protein depletion, helping
      to maintain functionality and energetic status. Impaired responses, as suggested 
      in nonsurvivors, could increase susceptibility to mitochondrial damage and
      cellular energetic failure or impede the ability to recover normal function.

TI  - Cerebral microembolization during primary total hip arthroplasty and
      neuropsychologic outcome: a pilot study.
PG  - 1621-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative cerebral microembolization occurs in a substantial
      proportion of patients undergoing THA. Historically, postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction has been attributed to different factors, including anesthesia, but
      the influence of the surgery has not been thoroughly examined.
      QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We conducted a prospective, controlled clinical trial to
      assess intraoperative cerebral microembolization during THA and neuropsychologic 
      outcome. METHODS: The presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) also was
      investigated, using transcranial Doppler, to determine whether this affected
      cerebral microembolic incidence and load and whether microemboli occurred as a
      result of specific surgical activity. Forty-five patients were recruited who
      underwent THA and neuropsychologic assessment; a battery of tests was
      administered preoperatively and at 6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS:
      Overall, patients showed improvement in total neuropsychologic change scores at
      both postoperative intervals. The incidence of cerebral microembolization for THA
      was 23%. The prevalence of PFO was 37%. PFO did not appear to influence
      microemboli load or incidence. More microemboli were seen during femoral
      component insertion and impaction. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative cerebral
      microembolization occurs in a substantial proportion of patients during THA
      recorded by transcranial Doppler. The microemboli load is low and is not
      influenced by the presence of PFO. Certain surgical activities seem responsible
      for greater cerebral microemboli generation. However, neuropsychologic outcome
      was not affected postoperatively by microemboli or other operative or patient
      variables.

TI  - Major elective joint replacement surgery: socioeconomic variations in surgical
      risk, postoperative morbidity and length of stay.
PG  - 529-38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient deprivation is associated with greater need for total hip and
      knee replacement surgery (THR/TKR) and a higher prevalence of risk factors for
      surgical complications. Our aim was to examine associations between deprivation
      and aspects of the inpatient episode for patients undergoing these procedures.
      METHODS: We analysed socioeconomic variations in preoperative surgical risk,
      postoperative morbidity and length of stay for 655 patients undergoing elective
      THR/TKR at a large metropolitan hospital. Surgical risk was assessed using the
      orthopaedic version of the POSSUM scoring system, postoperative morbidity was
      assessed using the postoperative morbidity survey, and socioeconomic status was
      measured using the Index of Multiple Deprivation. We adjusted for age, sex,
      surgical site and primary vs. revision surgery. RESULTS: We found only a modest, 
      clinically insignificant socioeconomic gradient in preoperative surgical risk and
      no socioeconomic gradient in postoperative morbidity. There was a strong
      socioeconomic gradient in length of stay, but only for patients undergoing TKR.
      This was due to deprived patients being more likely to remain in hospital without
      morbidity following TKR. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest differential selection
      of healthier patients for surgery. Hospitals serving deprived communities may
      have excess, unfunded costs because of the increased length of stay of
      socioeconomically disadvantaged patients.

TI  - Prevalence of acetabular cartilage lesions and labral tears in femoroacetabular
      impingement.
PG  - 181-8
AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of associated acetabular
      cartilage lesions and labral tears in patients with cam-type femoro-acetabular
      impingement (FAI). We evaluated acetabular cartilage lesions and labral tears
      found during hip arthroscopy in 52 patients with radiological signs of cam-type
      FAI. We found a high prevalence of associated lesions (86.5%) in patients with
      cam-type FAI. They were graded according to the morphology, extent, and location 
      of the lesion. Forty-one patients (78.8%) had an acetabular cartilage lesion.
      Labral tears were found in 31 patients (59.6%). There was a high correlation
      between age and the presence and extent of acetabular cartilage and labral
      lesions (r = 0.70; p < 0.0001 and r = 0.45; p <0.001 respectively). There was
      also a high correlation between the extent of the acetabular cartilage lesion and
      the presence of labral lesions (r = 0.62; p < 0.0001). Despite the recognized
      consequences of associated lesions on treatment and outcome, no classification
      system includes this aspect of FAI. Based on our findings, we developed a system 
      to grade acetabular cartilage lesions according to their morphology and extent.
      This information can help to define the natural history of cam-type FAI, and to
      determine appropriate treatment.

TI  - Antithrombotic treatment failures in antiphospholipid syndrome: the new
      anticoagulants?
PG  - 486-91
AB  - Anticoagulation with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is the mainstay of the
      treatment of venous and/or arterial thromboembolism in patients with
      antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), although the optimal intensity of
      anticoagulation remains controversial. The limitations of existing anticoagulants
      have driven a search for novel agents. Dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa), a direct
      thrombin inhibitor (DTI), and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), the first in a new class of 
      drugs, the oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, are both fixed-dose orally
      administered agents. They are now licensed in the UK and Europe for the
      prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective 
      total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR). Prospective
      randomized clinical trials suggest that these agents, and also apixaban, a
      further oral direct anti-Xa inhibitor, may have potential in other areas
      including the treatment of acute VTE, prevention of stroke or systemic embolism
      in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute coronary syndromes. Here, we 
      summarize current indications for these agents and address the potential for
      their use in patients with thrombotic APS.

TI  - Multi-centre cluster randomised trial comparing a community group exercise
      programme with home based exercise with usual care for people aged 65 and over in
      primary care: protocol of the ProAct 65+ trial.
PG  - 6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity reduces the risk of mortality from all
      causes, with a powerful beneficial effect on risk of falls and hip fractures.
      However, physical activity levels are low in the older population and previous
      studies have demonstrated only modest, short-term improvements in activity levels
      with intervention. DESIGN/METHODS: Pragmatic 3 arm parallel design cluster
      controlled trial of class-based exercise (FAME), home-based exercise (OEP) and
      usual care amongst older people (aged 65 years and over) in primary care. The
      primary outcome is the achievement of recommended physical activity targets 12
      months after cessation of intervention. Secondary outcomes include functional
      assessments, predictors of exercise adherence, the incidence of falls, fear of
      falling, quality of life and continuation of physical activity after
      intervention, over a two-year follow up. An economic evaluation including
      participant and NHS costs will be embedded in the clinical trial. DISCUSSION: The
      ProAct65 trial will explore and evaluate the potential for increasing physical
      activity among older people recruited through general practice. The trial will be
      conducted in a relatively unselected population, and will address problems of
      selective recruitment, potentially low retention rates, variable quality of
      interventions and falls risk. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial Registration:

TI  - Custom uncemented revision stems based on a femoral classification.
PG  - 18-25
AB  - From the outcome of 175 cases, a group of 4 types of custom-designed HA-coated
      hip stems, based upon an incremental scale of bone condition, was demonstrated to
      be sufficient for use with the variety of cavitary defects encountered in
      revision hip surgery. Harris Hip Score evaluation showed a significant
      improvement in hip pain and function. Radiographic measurements of axial
      migration over a 4-year period were less than 2 mm. The migration data were
      similar across the 4 types of revision stem. A follow-up using DEXA scans showed 
      preservation of bone in all regions up to 4 years, which justifies the design
      rationale for the close fit of the stems in the proximal region in achieving
      initial stability and strain transfer.

TI  - Uncemented revision hip arthroplasty in B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral
      fractures - A prospective analysis.
PG  - 38-42
AB  - Periprosthetic femoral fractures are an increasingly common complication of total
      hip arthroplasty. If there is a fracture of the femur in the presence of an
      unstable prosthesis (Vancouver type B2 and B3), revision of the stem is
      imperative. We describe our experience of cementless femoral revision in
      management of twenty-six patients who sustained periprosthetic fractures of the
      Vancouver type B2 or B3, between February 1999 and March 2005. All patients were 
      managed by revision arthroplasty, using cementless femoral stems. Cortical
      struts, cable plating systems, bone allograft and demineralised bone matrix were 
      used to aid the reconstruction where indicated. All the fractures had clinical
      and radiological union. The outcome was graded, subjectively as satisfactory by
      all patients and this is substantiated objectively, by a post operative mean
      Harris hip score of 83.04. Uncemented revision appears to be an attractive option
      for periprosthetic fractures with unstable femoral stems.

TI  - Does diabetes mellitus predispose to increased fluid overload in peritoneal
      dialysis patients?
PG  - c60-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic peritoneal dialysis patients have been reported to have
      faster peritoneal solute transport and may be at risk of reduced ultrafiltration 
      volumes, leading to fluid overload. METHODS: We audited multi-frequency
      bioimpedance data from 198 consecutive peritoneal dialysis patients (141
      nondiabetics and 57 diabetics). RESULTS: Diabetic patients had increased body
      mass index (males 27 +/- 4 vs. 26 +/- 4; females 28 +/- 5 vs. 25 +/- 4; p < 0.01 
      for both), waist to hip ratio (males 0.94 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.04; females
      0.99 +/- 0.9 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.09; p < 0.01 for both) and body fat (males 31 +/- 8
      vs. 26 +/- 11%, p < 0.05; females 40 +/- 8 vs. 33 +/- 10%, p < 0.01) compared to 
      nondiabetic patients. D4/P creatinine was greater for the female diabetic
      patients than the nondiabetic patients (0.75 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.1; p =
      0.044); otherwise, the peritoneal equilibrium test (PET) results did not differ. 
      Extracellular water (ECW) adjusted for height was similar in diabetic and
      nondiabetic patients, but the ratio of ECW to total body water (TBW) was greater 
      for diabetics (males 0.40 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.01; females 0.39 +/- 0.01 vs.
      0.38 +/- 0.01; p < 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic and nondiabetic patients
      had similar PET results, 24-hour net peritoneal ultrafiltration and blood
      pressure control. The ratio of ECW to TBW was greater in diabetic patients, and
      although this could be due to a loss of intracellular water, as albumin and
      C-reactive protein did not differ, it suggests that diabetic peritoneal dialysis 
      patients have an expanded extracellular volume.

TI  - Augmentation of bone growth onto the acetabular cup surface using bone marrow
      stromal cells in total hip replacement surgery.
PG  - 3689-96
AB  - Aseptic loosening of acetabular components in total hip arthroplasty is the major
      cause of implant failure. Our hypothesis was that spraying autologous bone
      marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) in fibrin glue onto the surface of
      hydroxyapatite-coated uncemented acetabular components would increase bone
      formation and contact in a caprine model. Ten million BMSCs were sprayed onto the
      acetabular cup at the time of surgery. Animals in the control group received
      fibrin glue only. Ground reaction force measurements were taken preoperatively
      and at 6 and 12 weeks postsurgery. After retrieval at 12 weeks new bone
      formation, bone-implant contact and fibrous tissue thickness adjacent to the cup 
      were quantified. Viability and proliferation assays showed that the majority of
      the BMSCs survived spraying in fibrin glue at pressures of up to 1.5 atm. New
      bone growth adjacent to the bone implant interface in the BMSC-treated group
      (71.42 +/- 8.97%) was 30% greater than in control (54.22 +/- 16.56%) although
      this difference was not statistically significant. However, significantly
      increased new bone formation was measured at the periphery of the cup (zone 5) in
      the BMSC-treated group (71.97 +/- 10.91%) when compared with control (23.85 +/-
      15.13%, p = 0.028). Bone-implant contact was significantly greater in the
      BMSC-treated group (20.03 +/- 4.64%) (control: 13.71 +/- 8.32%, p = 0.027);
      correspondingly, the average thickness of the fibrous tissue membrane where
      present was significantly reduced at the periphery of the cups in the
      BMSC-treated group (327.49 +/- 20.38 mum) when compared with control (887.21 +/- 
      158.89 mum) (p = 0.02). This study has clinical applications as greater bone
      contact at the cup surface will improve fixation and may decrease longer-term
      aseptic loosening by preventing wear debris-induced bone loss at the implant
      interface.

TI  - Aluminum exposure from parenteral nutrition in preterm infants: bone health at
      15-year follow-up.
PG  - 1372-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aluminum has known neurotoxicity and may impair short-term bone
      health. In a randomized trial, we showed reduced neurodevelopmental scores in
      preterm infants who were previously exposed to aluminum from parenteral nutrition
      solutions. Here, in the same cohort, we test the hypothesis that neonatal
      aluminum exposure also adversely affects long-term bone health, as indicated by
      reduced bone mass. METHODS: Bone area (BA) and bone mineral content (BMC) of
      lumbar spine, hip, and whole body were measured with dual radiograph
      absorptiometry in 13- to 15-year-olds who were born preterm and randomly assigned
      standard or aluminum-depleted parenteral nutrition solutions during the neonatal 
      period. RESULTS: Fifty-nine children (32% of survivors) were followed. Those who 
      were randomly assigned to standard parenteral nutrition solution had lower lumbar
      spine BMC, apparently explained by a concomitant decrease in bone size. In
      nonrandomized analyses, children who were exposed to neonatal aluminum intakes
      above the median (55 microg/kg) had lower hip BMC (by 7.6% [95% confidence
      interval: 0.12-13.8]; P = 0.02), [corrected] independent of bone (or body) size. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Neonates who are exposed to parenteral aluminum may have reduced
      lumbar spine and hip bone mass during adolescence, potential risk factors for
      later osteoporosis and hip fracture. These findings need confirmation in larger, 
      more detailed studies. Nevertheless, given our previous finding of adverse
      developmental outcome in these individuals and the sizeable number of
      contemporary infants who undergo intensive neonatal care and are still exposed to
      aluminum via parenteral feeding solutions, the potential adverse long-term
      consequences of early aluminum exposure now deserve renewed attention.

TI  - Intra-operative cerebral microembolisation during primary hybrid total hip
      arthroplasty compared with primary hip resurfacing.
PG  - 671-7
AB  - Fat embolism during total joint arthroplasty or intramedullary procedures is well
      documented and is infrequently fatal. Considerable morbidity is associated with
      fat embolism syndrome, and post operative cognitive dysfunction is frequently
      seen, yet the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. Intraoperative cerebral
      microemboli can be detected using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and moreover
      the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) may be examined for using a
      validated technique employing this modality. Persistent patent foramen ovale may 
      act as a conduit for embolic material to traverse from the venous to the systemic
      circulation and consequently affect cerebral function. We wished to 1)
      investigate the incidence of cerebral microembolisation during primary hybrid
      total hip arthroplasty and compare this with hip resurfacing, 2) examine the
      influence of patent foramen ovale on cerebral microembolisation and 3)assess the 
      influence of cerebral microemboli on the outcome of patients undergoing these
      procedures. We prospectively compared 12 patients undergoing hip resurfacing with
      12 patients undergoing hybrid total hip replacement (THR) for the incidence and
      load of intraoperative cerebral microemboli, using transcranial Doppler. All
      patients were tested for the presence of a patent foramen ovale using a validated
      technique. Outcome was assessed using the WOMAC, Harris Hip Score, Oxford Hip
      Score and EuroQoL quality of life measure. No patient in the hip resurfacing
      group demonstrated intra-operative cerebral microembolisation. Five patients in
      the THR group showed transcranial Doppler evidence of microemobli during the
      procedure. With the small numbers of patients available, there was not a
      significant difference in microemboli load between the groups (p = 0.09). There
      was no significant difference between the groups regarding the incidence of PFO
      (p = 0.78). There was no significant relationship between the incidence and total
      microemboli load and the incidence of PFO (p = 0.56). There was no significant
      difference in outcome at six months between patients who demonstrated microemboli
      and those who did not. The incidence of cerebral microembolisation during hip
      resurfacing appears to be very low. Although our study demonstrated cerebral
      microemboli in a significant proportion of patients undergoing primary hybrid
      THR, the numbers of microemboli were low and the presence of a patent foramen
      ovale did not influence microemboli incidence or load. Finally, patients who
      demonstrated cerebral microemboli did not have a worse outcome than patients who 
      did not.

TI  - Two-stage procedure in the treatment of late chronic hip infections--spacer
      implantation.
PG  - 253-7
AB  - Infection after total hip arthroplasties (THA) is a devastating complication with
      significant consequences for both the patients and the healthcare systems. In
      recent times, a two stage procedure using antibiotic-impregnated interim spacers 
      has become the most popular treatment for late chronic hip joint infections after
      THA with success rates over 90%. In this review, we discuss the different types
      of spacers used in the treatment of chronically infected THA and conclude that
      hip spacers are effective in the treatment of hip joint infections.

AB  - The challenges of acetabular revision include bone loss and poor bone biology.
      Favorable 10-year reports exist of uncemented acetabular revision using
      hemispherical uncemented sockets. In the presence of bone stock deficiency,
      adjunctive morsellized impaction bone grafting is a recognized means of restoring
      bone stock. We attempt to restore bone stock with impaction grafting beneath a
      cementless cup for contained defects, defects that can be rendered contained, and
      whenever there is capacity for rim fixation. The technique of bone graft
      preparation is important. We use a mixture of bone milling and bone chips of
      various sizes. Morsellized allograft is inserted, packed, and/or reverse reamed
      into any defects. The reconstruction relies on the ability to gain biological
      fixation of the component to the underlying host bone. This requires intimate
      host bone contact and rigid implant stability. The fixation is therefore
      augmented with screws in all cases. It is important to achieve host bone contact 
      in a least part of the dome and posterior column. When this is possible, and
      particularly when there is a good rim fit, we have not found it absolutely
      necessary to have contact with host bone over >50% of the surface. Stability of
      primary fixation is a better predictor of outcome than volume of graft or
      percentage of host bone contact. The advantages of bone grafting in acetabular
      reconstruction include the ability to restore bone stock, rebuild a normal hip
      center and hip biomechanics, and increase bone stock for future revisions.

TI  - Treatment for 24 months with recombinant human GH has a beneficial effect on bone
      mineral density in young adults with childhood-onset GH deficiency.
PG  - 899-907
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Discontinuation of growth hormone (GH) therapy on completion of linear
      growth may adversely affect bone mineral density (BMD) in young adults with
      childhood-onset GH-deficiency (GHD). In the present study, we analyzed the impact
      of GH treatment on bone in young adults with GHD. METHODS: BMD at the lumbar
      spine (L2-L4), total hip, and total body was measured at baseline and after 24
      months in a cohort of young adults (18-25 years; n=160) with severe GHD treated
      with GH during childhood who were randomized to GH (n=109) or no treatment (n=51)
      in a multicenter, multinational, open-label study. GH starting doses (0.2 mg/day 
      (males), 0.4 mg/day (females)) were increased after 1 month to 0.6 mg/day (males)
      and 0.9 mg/day (females) and then to 1.0 mg/day (males) and 1.4 mg/day (females) 
      at 3 months for the remainder of the study. RESULTS: After 24 months, lumbar
      spine BMD had increased significantly more in GH-treated patients than in
      controls (6 vs 2%; estimated treatment difference; 3.5% (95% confidence interval,
      1.52-5.51) P<0.001). GH also had a significant positive effect on total hip BMD
      (P=0.015). Total body BMD was unchanged from baseline (P=0.315). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      young adults treated for childhood-onset GHD, there is a beneficial effect of
      continued GH treatment on BMD in adult life. Twenty-four months of GH treatment
      in these young adults was associated with an estimated 3.5% greater increase in
      BMD of the lumbar spine compared with controls.

TI  - The effect of the femoral head ossific nucleus in the treatment of developmental 
      dysplasia of the hip. A meta-analysis.
PG  - 911-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of the presence of the femoral head ossific nucleus as a
      risk factor for the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head in infants
      with developmental dysplasia of the hip has been investigated in several small
      studies, but the results have been inconsistent. The purpose of the present study
      was to determine the effect of the presence of the ossific nucleus on the
      development of osteonecrosis. METHODS: A systematic review of the medical
      literature from 1966 to 2007 was performed. Two independent reviewers evaluated
      all articles. Interrater agreement was determined, and the quality of evidence
      was evaluated. A meta-analysis was then performed with the main outcome defined
      as the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head two years after
      reduction. RESULTS: Six observational studies (five retrospective and one
      prospective) met the inclusion criteria. Inconsistency was found in that half of 
      the studies demonstrated a protective effect of the ossific nucleus on the
      development of osteonecrosis whereas half of the studies did not. A meta-analysis
      (including 358 patients) showed no significant effect of the presence of the
      ossific nucleus on the development of grades-I through IV osteonecrosis, with
      forty-one cases of osteonecrosis (19%) found in infants in whom the ossific
      nucleus had been present at the time of hip reduction compared with thirty cases 
      (22%) in the group without an ossific nucleus (relative risk=0.75, 95% confidence
      interval=0.46 to 1.21). When only radiographic changes of grade II or worse were 
      considered to represent osteonecrosis, a significant difference in the prevalence
      of osteonecrosis was found, with fourteen cases of osteonecrosis (7%) in infants 
      with an ossific nucleus compared with eighteen cases (16%) in those without an
      ossific nucleus (relative risk=0.43, 95% confidence interval=0.20 to 0.90). A
      subgroup analysis showed that the presence of the ossific nucleus reduced the
      probability of osteonecrosis by 60% (relative risk=0.41, 95% confidence
      interval=0.18 to 0.91) after closed reduction, but no significant effect was
      found in patients treated with open reduction (relative risk=1.14, 95% confidence
      interval=0.62 to 2.07). All studies demonstrated methodological weaknesses
      compromising the quality of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find that the
      presence of the ossific nucleus had a significant effect on the development of
      osteonecrosis of any grade after hip reduction in infants with developmental
      dysplasia of the hip. The meta-analysis suggested that the presence of the
      ossific nucleus has a protective effect against the development of the more
      severe forms of femoral head osteonecrosis. However, the quality of evidence is
      moderate, and additional research is likely to have an important impact on the
      confidence in the estimate of the effect and may change this estimate.

TI  - The importance of a thick cement mantle depends on stem geometry and stem-cement 
      interfacial bonding.
PG  - 315-27
AB  - The thickness of the cement mantle around the femoral component of total hip
      replacements is a contributing factor to aseptic loosening and revision.
      Nevertheless, various designs of stems and surgical tooling lead to cement
      mantles of different thicknesses. Opinion is divided on whether a thick mantle
      enhances implant longevity. This study investigates the effect of cement mantle
      thickness on accumulated damage in the cement, and how this is influenced by the 
      presence or absence of a proximal collar and on whether the stem-cement interface
      remains bonded. Three-dimensional finite element simulations incorporating creep 
      and non-linear damage accumulation were performed to investigate cracking in the 
      cement mantles around Stanmore Hips under physiologically informed stair-climbing
      and gait loads. Cement mantle thickness, stem-cement interfacial bonding, and
      collar design were varied to assess the interactive effects of these parameters. 
      In all cases, damage levels were three to six times higher when the stem-cement
      interface remained bonded. Cement mantle thickness had little effect on cement
      damage accumulation around debonded collared stems but was critical in both
      bonded and collarless cases, where a thicker mantle reduced cement cracking.
      Damage around a smooth debonded stem with a collar is thus much less sensitive to
      cement thickness than around bonded or collarless stems.

TI  - Television viewing and obesity: a prospective study in the 1958 British birth
      cohort.
PG  - 1355-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether frequency of television viewing in adolescence (11
      and 16 years) or early adulthood (23 years) affected subsequent changes in body
      mass index (BMI) through to mid-adulthood life, and waist-hip ratio in
      mid-adulthood. SUBJECTS: The 1958 British birth cohort includes all births in 1
      week in March 1958 in England, Scotland and Wales. The main analyses included at 
      least 11 301 participants. Outcome measures included BMI at 16, 23, 33 and 45
      years and waist-hip ratio at 45 years. RESULTS: Watching television 'often' at 16
      years (but not 11 years) was associated with a faster gain in BMI between 16 and 
      45 years in males (0.011 kg m(-2) per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.003,
      0.019) and females (0.013 kg m(-2) per year, 95%CI 0.003, 0.023). More frequent
      television viewing at 11, 16 and 23 years was associated with a faster gain in
      BMI between 23 and 45 years in females, but not in males. Television viewing at
      23 years was associated with waist-hip ratio at 45 years: participants watching >
      or = 5 times per week had a waist-hip ratio 0.01 higher than those watching less 
      often. At 45 years, those watching television for > or = 4 h day(-1) had a
      waist-hip ratio 0.03-0.04 higher than those watching for <1 h day(-1).
      CONCLUSIONS: More frequent television viewing in adolescence and early adulthood 
      is associated with greater BMI gains through to mid-adulthood and with central
      adiposity in mid-life. Television viewing may be a useful behaviour to target in 
      strategies to prevent obesity.

TI  - Child-to-adult body mass index and height trajectories: a comparison of 2 British
      birth cohorts.
PG  - 1008-15
AB  - Markers of growth and changes of body mass index (BMI) are associated with adult 
      chronic disease risk. To better understand such associations, the authors
      examined the 1946 (n approximately 5,300) and 1958 (n approximately 17,000)
      British birth cohorts to establish how child-to-adult height and BMI have changed
      across generations. Individuals born in 1958 were no heavier at birth than those 
      born in 1946, but they were taller in childhood by about 1 cm on average, grew
      faster thereafter, and were 3-4 cm taller by adolescence. The 1958 cohort
      achieved adult height earlier and were taller by 1 cm, an increase that was
      entirely due to their longer leg length. BMI trajectories diverged from early
      adulthood, with a faster rate of BMI gain in the 1958 cohort than in the 1946
      cohort, although the mean BMI at 7 years and rate of childhood gain had not shown
      an increase. By midadulthood, the 1958 cohort had on average a greater BMI (1-2
      kg/m(2)), larger waist (6-7 cm) and hip (5 cm) circumferences, and a higher
      prevalence of obesity (25.1% vs. 10.8% in males and 23.7% vs. 14.8% in females). 
      Changes in height and adiposity over a relatively short period of 12 years
      suggest the likelihood of opposing trends of influences on later disease risk in 
      these populations.

TI  - Infection following hip replacement: solution options.
PG  - 907-8
AB  - The key to the optimal management of an acutely infected arthroplasty is an
      expeditious diagnosis with careful assessment of the mode of presentation and
      treatment variables to determine the appropriate management strategy. At our
      institution acute infection is managed early and aggressively with debridement
      and exchange of mobile parts and change of the implant if it is cementless. For
      established chronic infection, each case is considered individually, using
      single-stage exchange in selected circumstances (1 in 6 cases). Two-stage
      exchange with an articulating spacer is used in the remainder. Single-stage
      revision offers clinical and economic advantages over a two-stage revision in
      selected patients, and although ongoing evaluation is still in place, currently
      we have had no reinfections in our single-stage revision cohort.

TI  - Arterial stiffness and inflammatory response to psychophysiological stress.
PG  - 941-8
AB  - The processes through which psychological stress influences cardiovascular
      disease are poorly understood, but may involve activation of hemodynamic,
      neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses. We assessed the relationship between
      carotid arterial stiffness and inflammatory responses to acute psychophysiologic 
      stress. Participants were 155 healthy men and women aged 55.3, SD 2.7 years.
      Blood samples for the assessment of plasma fibrinogen, tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) alpha and interleukin (IL) 6 were drawn at baseline, immediately following 
      standardized behavioral tasks, and 45 min later. Carotid artery stiffness was
      measured ultrasonically three years later, and blood pressure and heart rate
      responses were recorded. The tasks induced substantial increases in blood
      pressure and heart rate, together with increased fibrinogen, TNFalpha and IL-6
      concentration. Carotid stiffness was positively associated with body mass,
      waist/hip ratio, blood pressure, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and
      C-reactive protein, and inversely with high density lipoprotein and grade of
      employment. Baseline levels of inflammatory variables were not related to carotid
      artery stiffness. But carotid stiffness was greater in participants with larger
      fibrinogen (p=0.037) and TNFalpha (p=0.036) responses to psychophysiological
      stress. These effects were independent of age, gender, grade of employment,
      smoking, body mass, waist/hip ratio, systolic and diastolic pressure, high and
      low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein. There were no
      associations between carotid stiffness and stress responses in IL-6, blood
      pressure, or heart rate. We conclude that individual differences in inflammatory 
      responses to psychophysiological stress are independently related to structural
      changes in artery walls that reflect increased cardiovascular disease risk.

TI  - Comparison of bone mineral density and body proportions between women with

PG  - 179-85
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare bone mineral density (BMD) and body proportions between
      women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) and with gonadal
      dysgenesis (GD). SETTING: Adult Disorders of Sexual Development and Ovarian
      Failure Clinics at University College London Hospitals. DESIGN: Retrospective
      cross-sectional study of three groups of women aged 17-58 years with varying
      degrees of exposure to sex hormones and different combinations of sex
      chromosomes. Forty-six subjects had CAIS, 18 had GD and 46,XY (GD(XY)), and 25
      had GD and 46,XX (GD(XX)). In addition, body proportions of subgroups of these
      women were analysed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Oestrogen therapy, karyotype,
      anthropometry and BMD. RESULTS: Height differed between groups (F ratio 5.2,
      P=0.007)), with GD(XX) women being the shortest (mean+/-s.d.: 1.66+/-0.10 m),
      GD(XY) women the tallest (1.74+/-0.09 m) and CAIS women were in-between
      (1.70+/-0.07 m). Delayed gonadectomy resulted in taller stature in CAIS women
      (P=0.011). The ratio of lower to upper body length in GD(XY) women was
      significantly (P=0.001) greater than that of CAIS women. Multivariate logistic
      regression analysis (adjusted for age and height) showed that among women with XY
      karyotype, GD(XY) women were 5.2 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3-20.1,
      P=0.018) more likely than CAIS women to have a low hip BMD. This difference was
      not evident among women with GD of different karyotypes (P=0.938). Spinal BMD did
      not differ between subject groups. Further adjustment for oestrogen replacement
      did not alter these relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Taller stature in late
      gonadectomised CAIS women suggests an oestrogen deficiency in these women prior
      to gonadectomy. Increased lower to upper body ratio in GD(XY) women compared with
      the other groups implies that these subjects have the greatest degree of
      oestrogen deficiency in puberty. Androgen rather than sex chromosomes may play an
      important role in cortical bone mineralisation in CAIS women, probably via
      estrogen receptor-alpha either directly or via aromatisation during critical
      periods of growth prior to gonadectomy.

TI  - Association of age at menarche with cardiovascular risk factors, vascular
      structure, and function in adulthood: the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns
      study.
PG  - 1876-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether age at menarche is an independent determinant
      of future cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether
      menarcheal age is an independent predictor of body mass index (BMI) and a wide
      range of cardiovascular risk factors in adolescence and adulthood. DESIGN: We
      examined the associations of menarcheal age with BMI (in kg/m(2)) and other
      cardiovascular risk factors in adolescence and adulthood in a population-based
      sample of 794 female adolescents aged 9-18 y at baseline. Their age at first
      menstruation was requested at baseline and again 3 and 6 y later. Cardiovascular 
      risk factors were assessed at baseline and at age 30-39 y. RESULTS: A 1-y
      decrease in menarcheal age was associated with 0.81 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.08) higher
      adult BMI as well as greater waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, elevated
      systolic blood pressure, higher insulin resistance, and greater risk of metabolic
      syndrome (P < 0.05 for all). In multivariable analysis in which these adult risk 
      factors were mutually adjusted for, only the inverse association between age at
      menarche and adult BMI remained. However, this inverse association was lost after
      adjustment for premenarcheal BMI (beta: -0.16; 95% CI -0.55, 0.23; P = 0.42).
      Higher premenarcheal BMI predicted earlier menarche, and the strong association
      between premenarcheal BMI and adult BMI was robust to adjustment for age at
      menarche. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that early menarche is only a risk 
      marker. Greater childhood BMI seems to contribute to earlier age at menarche and,
      because of tracking, greater adult BMI and associated cardiovascular risk. An
      independent effect of early menarche on adult adiposity cannot be excluded, but
      it is likely to be small at best.

TI  - Use of mesenchymal stem cells to enhance bone formation around revision hip
      replacements.
PG  - 880-5
AB  - Tissue engineering approaches to regenerate bone stock in revision total hip
      replacements could enhance the longevity of the implant and benefit the quality
      of the patient's life. This study investigated the impaction of allograft with
      mesenchymal stem cells in an ovine hip hemiarthroplasty model. In total, 10 sheep
      were divided into two groups with 5 sheep in each group. The groups were: 1)
      mesenchymal stem cells mixed with allograft; 2) allograft only as a control.
      Ground reaction force was assessed for limb function and showed that there was no
      significant difference in the recovery for animals in different groups. The
      amount of bone regenerated around the hip replacement was assessed using
      un-decalcified histology. The results showed that the stem cell group generated
      significantly more new bone at the implant-allograft interface and within the
      graft than the control group. The results from this study indicate that the use
      of stem cells on an allograft scaffold increases bone formation indicating that
      the use of stem cells for revision hip arthroplasty may be beneficial for
      patients undergoing revision surgery where the bone stock is compromised.

TI  - Outcome measures for orthopaedic interventions on the hip.
PG  - 545-9
AB  - Orthopaedic outcome measures are used to evaluate the effect of operative
      interventions. They are used for audit and research. Knowledge of these measures 
      is becoming increasingly important with league tables comparing surgeons and
      hospitals being made accessible to the profession and the general public. Several
      types of tool are available to describe outcome after hip surgery such as generic
      quality-of-life questionnaires, disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaires, 
      hip-specific outcome measures and general short-term clinical measures. We
      provide an overview of the outcome measures commonly used to evaluate hip
      interventions.

TI  - Prevention of strain-related osteopenia in aseptic loosening of hip prostheses
      using perioperative bisphosphonate.
PG  - 693-703
AB  - The hypothesis tested in this study was that perioperative administration of the 
      bisphosphonate zoledronate will reduce strain protection-related calcar
      osteopenia and maintain functional integration of the femoral component in an
      ovine hemiarthroplasty model. Twelve sheep received a unilateral cemented
      hemiarthroplasty where six animals were given nine intravenous infusions of
      zoledronate (10 microg/kg) pre-, peri-, and postsurgery over 8 months. Control
      animals received physiological saline only. Implants remained in vivo for 9
      months. Ground reaction force (GRF) was used to assess functional loading of the 
      implanted limb, bone mineral density (BMD) was quantified using dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA). Cortical bone area, thickness, and viable osteocytes were 
      assessed histologically. No significant differences in GRF data between groups
      was identified. Results demonstrated a significant drop in BMD values in the
      control group (9.7%) when compared with the bisphosphonate-treated group (3.2%)
      (p = 0.0159). Histological results showed that cortical area, thickness, and the 
      percentage of lacunae with viable osteocytes was significantly greater in the
      bisphosphonate-treated group when compared with control (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, p 
      = 0.003, respectively). The administration of zoledronate reduced cortical
      osteopenia in the calcar region of the proximal femur and this therapy could be
      used as a preventive measure to combat strain protection osteopenia and its
      contribution to associated aseptic loosening in total hip replacement surgery.

TI  - Impaction grafting with a bone-graft substitute in a sheep model of revision hip

PG  - 246-53
AB  - An experimental sheep model was used for impaction allografting of 12
      hemiarthroplasty femoral components placed into two equal-sized groups. In group 
      1, a 50:50 mixture of ApaPore hydroxyapatite bone-graft substitute and allograft 
      was used. In group 2, ApaPore and allograft were mixed in a 90:10 ratio. Both
      groups were killed at six months. Ground reaction force results demonstrated no
      significant differences (p > 0.05) between the two groups at 8, 16 and 24 weeks
      post-operatively, and all animals remained active. The mean bone turnover rates
      were significantly greater in group 1, at 0.00206 mm/day, compared to group 2 at 
      0.0013 mm/day (p < 0.05). The results for the area of new bone formation
      demonstrated no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the two groups. No
      significant differences were found between the two groups in thickness of the
      cement mantle (p > 0.05) and percentage ApaPore-bone contact (p > 0.05). The
      results of this animal study demonstrated that a mixture of ApaPore allograft in 
      a 90:10 ratio was comparable to using a 50:50 mixture.

TI  - Neuroendocrine and inflammatory factors associated with positive affect in
      healthy men and women: the Whitehall II study.
PG  - 96-102
AB  - Positive affective states are associated with favorable health outcomes, but the 
      underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The authors assessed associations
      between positive affect, cortisol sampled over the day, and inflammatory markers 
      (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) among 2,873 healthy members of the
      Whitehall II study. Data for this study were collected in 2002-2004 in London,
      United Kingdom. Saliva free cortisol was assessed on waking, 30 minutes later,
      and four times over the day and evening. Positive affect was indexed by
      aggregating ecological momentary assessments of positive mood over the day.
      Salivary cortisol averaged over the day was inversely associated with positive
      affect after controlling for age, gender, income, ethnicity, body mass index,
      waist/hip ratio, smoking, paid employment, time of waking in the morning, and
      depression (p = 0.003). There was no association with cortisol responses to
      waking. The adjusted odds of C-reactive protein >/=3.00 mg/liter was 1.89 (95%
      confidence interval: 1.08, 3.31) in low- compared with high-positive-affect
      women, and plasma interleukin-6 was also inversely related to positive affect in 
      women (p = 0.016). Neither inflammatory marker was related to positive affect in 
      men. These results confirm findings from smaller studies relating cortisol with
      positive affect while suggesting that in women, positive affect is associated
      with reduced levels of inflammatory markers.

TI  - The representation of epilepsy in popular music.
PG  - 165-9
AB  - Much can be learned about the contemporary stereotypes associated with epilepsy
      by studying the representation of the disorder in paintings, literature, and
      movies. Popular music is arguably the most accessible and ubiquitous of the
      creative art forms, touching most of us on a daily basis. Reviewed here are the
      ways in which epilepsy and seizures are used in the lyrics of musicians from a
      wide variety of musical genres, from hip-hop to rhythm and blues. Many of the
      ancient associations of epilepsy with madness, horror, and lunacy can be found in
      these lyrics. However, the language of epilepsy has also been appropriated by
      some musical artists to represent a state of sexual ecstasy and dance euphoria.
      The references to these states as "epilepsy" or a "seizure" in numerous songs
      suggest that this shorthand is widely recognized within some subcultures.
      Although epilepsy has frequently been associated with female sexual availability 
      in other creative art forms, this novel use of the language of epilepsy
      represents a contemporary departure in the artistic application of
      epilepsy-related images and associations in the 21st century.

TI  - The association between father's social class and adult obesity is not explained 
      by educational attainment and an unhealthy lifestyle in adulthood.
PG  - 573-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of father's social class on central and
      general obesity in adulthood. To test the role of educational attainment and
      adult health behaviours as mediators in this association. METHODS: BMI,
      Waist-hip-ratio, smoking status, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical
      activity and dietary intake (semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire) were
      assessed at phase 5 (1997-1998) of the Whitehall II cohort study. We used
      retrospective data on educational attainment and father's social class. Our study
      sample was 4598 participants (3364 men, 1234 women) aged 44-69, with a valid
      obesity measure and information on father's social class and educational
      attainment. RESULTS: Father's social class was inversely associated with adult
      life central (Waist-hip-ratio) and general (BMI) obesity in women but not in men.
      For example, mean BMI difference between the highest and lowest childhood social 
      class was 2.04 kg/m(2) (95% confidence intervals: 0.90; 3.18). These associations
      remained robust to adjustment for adult life socioeconomic position. Adjusting
      for educational attainment resulted in a reduction of 10-15% in the difference in
      mean obesity measures between lowest and highest father's social class. In our
      fully adjusted model, adult life health behaviours did not provide further
      attenuation of the effect of father's social class on adult obesity. CONCLUSION: 
      We provide evidence for an independent effect of father's social class on adult
      central and general obesity in women, which is not explained by educational
      attainment and an unhealthy lifestyle in adulthood. Policies aiming at reducing
      inequalities in obesity should tackle the problem of social inequality early in
      life.
