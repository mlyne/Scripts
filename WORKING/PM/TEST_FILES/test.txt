______________________________________________________________________________  Abstract
Motivation.   Provide a guide to open source tools that can be used as a reference to do text mining Method.   We apply the text processing language Perl and the statistical language R to two text databases, an accident description data base and a survey database. Results.   For the accident description data new variables are extracted from the free-form text data that are used to predict the likelihood of attorney involvement and the severity of claims.  For the survey data, the text mining identified key themes in the responses.  Thus, useful information that would not otherwise be available was derived from both databases. Conclusion.   Open source software can be used to apply text mining procedures to insurance text data. Availability.  The Perl and R programs along with the CAS survey data will be available on the CAS Web Site.

 1. INTRODUCTION Text mining is an emerging technology that can be used to augment existi ng data in corporate databases by making unstructured te xt data available for analysis.  An excellent introduction to text mining is provided by Weiss, et al. (2005).  Francis (2006) provides a short introduction to text
mining with a focus on insurance applications.  On e of the difficulties in getting started with text mining is acquiring the tools, i.e., the software fo r implementing text mining.  Much of the software is expensive and/or difficult to use.  For instan ce, some of the software requires purchase of expensive data mining suites.  Other commercial so ftware is more suited to large scale industrial strength applications such as cataloging and searching academic papers.  One innovation that has
made budget-friendly software av ailable to text miners is open source software.  Two of the very popular open source products that will be featured in this paper are R and Perl.  R is a programming
language that has wide acceptance for statistical an d applied mathematical applications.  Perl is a programming language that is particularly strong in text processing.  Both languages can be easily
downloaded from the Internet.  Moreover, a larg e body of literature now exists to guide users through specialized applications such as text mining .  This paper will rely heavily on information in the book Practical Text Mining in Perl  by Roger Bilisoy (2008) when illustrating text mining applications in Perl.
It will also rely heavily on the R  tm  library. While this library is described by Feinerer, Hornik, and Meyer (2008), the applications are not insurance applications, and a significant amount of trial and error can be required to achi eve successful application of the software to insurance problems.
