1: Reproducibility of Results  
The statistical reproducibility of measurements (often in a clinical context),
including the testing of instrumentation or techniques to obtain reproducible
results. The concept includes reproducibility of physiological measurements,
which may be used to develop rules to assess probability or prognosis, or
response to a stimulus; reproducibility of occurrence of a condition; and
reproducibility of experimental results.

1: Mitochondrial Diseases  
Diseases caused by abnormal function of the MITOCHONDRIA. They may be caused by
mutations, acquired or inherited, in mitochondrial DNA or in nuclear genes that
code for mitochondrial components. They may also be the result of acquired
mitochondria dysfunction due to adverse effects of drugs, infections, or other
environmental causes.

1: Retrospective Studies  
Studies used to test etiologic hypotheses in which inferences about an exposure
to putative causal factors are derived from data relating to characteristics of
persons under study or to events or experiences in their past. The essential
feature is that some of the persons under study have the disease or outcome of
interest and their characteristics are compared with those of unaffected
persons.

1: Antiphospholipid Syndrome  
The presence of antibodies directed against phospholipids (ANTIBODIES,
ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID). The condition is associated with a variety of diseases,
notably systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases,
thrombopenia, and arterial or venous thromboses. In pregnancy it can cause
abortion. Of the phospholipids, the cardiolipins show markedly elevated levels
of anticardiolipin antibodies (ANTIBODIES, ANTICARDIOLIPIN). Present also are
high levels of lupus anticoagulant (LUPUS COAGULATION INHIBITOR).

1: Drug Design  
The molecular designing of drugs for specific purposes (such as DNA-binding,
enzyme inhibition, anti-cancer efficacy, etc.) based on knowledge of molecular
properties such as activity of functional groups, molecular geometry, and
electronic structure, and also on information cataloged on analogous molecules.
Drug design is generally computer-assisted molecular modeling and does not
include pharmacokinetics, dosage analysis, or drug administration analysis.

1: Vitamin K  
A lipid cofactor that is required for normal blood clotting.  Several forms of
vitamin K have been identified: VITAMIN K 1 (phytomenadione) derived from
plants, VITAMIN K 2 (menaquinone) from bacteria, and synthetic naphthoquinone
provitamins, VITAMIN K 3 (menadione). Vitamin K 3 provitamins, after being
alkylated in vivo, exhibit the antifibrinolytic activity of vitamin K. Green
leafy vegetables, liver, cheese, butter, and egg yolk are good sources of
vitamin K.

1: Cost-Benefit Analysis  
A method of comparing the cost of a program with its expected benefits in
dollars (or other currency). The benefit-to-cost ratio is a measure of total
return expected per unit of money spent. This analysis generally excludes
consideration of factors that are not measured ultimately in economic terms.
Cost effectiveness compares alternative ways to achieve a specific set of
results.

1: Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated  
Minor hemoglobin components of human erythrocytes designated A1a, A1b, and A1c.
Hemoglobin A1c is most important since its sugar moiety is glucose covalently
bound to the terminal amino acid of the beta chain. Since normal glycohemoglobin
concentrations exclude marked blood glucose fluctuations over the preceding
three to four weeks, the concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin A is a more
reliable index of the blood sugar average over a long period of time.

irreversible kidney damage (as measured by the level of PROTEINURIA) and the
reduction in GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE to less than 15 ml per min (Kidney
Foundation: Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative, 2002). These patients
generally require HEMODIALYSIS or KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION.

1: Ultrafiltration  
The separation of particles from a suspension by passage through a filter with
very fine pores. In ultrafiltration the separation is accomplished by convective
transport; in DIALYSIS separation relies instead upon differential diffusion.
Ultrafiltration occurs naturally and is a laboratory procedure. Artificial
ultrafiltration of the blood is referred to as HEMOFILTRATION or
HEMODIAFILTRATION (if combined with HEMODIALYSIS).

1: Fibrin Tissue Adhesive  
An autologous or commercial tissue adhesive containing FIBRINOGEN and THROMBIN.
The commercial product is a two component system from human plasma that contains
more than fibrinogen and thrombin. The first component contains highly
concentrated fibrinogen, FACTOR VIII, fibronectin, and traces of other plasma
proteins. The second component contains thrombin, calcium chloride, and
antifibrinolytic agents such as APROTININ. Mixing of the two components promotes
BLOOD CLOTTING and the formation and cross-linking of fibrin. The tissue
adhesive is used for tissue sealing, HEMOSTASIS, and WOUND HEALING.

1: Absorptiometry, Photon  
A noninvasive method for assessing BODY COMPOSITION. It is based on the
differential absorption of  X-RAYS (or GAMMA RAYS) by different tissues such as
bone, fat and other soft tissues. The source of (X-ray or gamma-ray) photon beam
is generated either from radioisotopes such as GADOLINIUM 153, IODINE 125, or
Americanium 241 which emit GAMMA RAYS in the appropriate range; or from an X-ray
tube which produces X-RAYS in the desired range. It is primarily used for
quantitating BONE MINERAL CONTENT, especially for the diagnosis of OSTEOPOROSIS,
and also in measuring BONE MINERALIZATION.

1: Absorptiometry, Photon  
A noninvasive method for assessing BODY COMPOSITION. It is based on the
differential absorption of  X-RAYS (or GAMMA RAYS) by different tissues such as
bone, fat and other soft tissues. The source of (X-ray or gamma-ray) photon beam
is generated either from radioisotopes such as GADOLINIUM 153, IODINE 125, or
Americanium 241 which emit GAMMA RAYS in the appropriate range; or from an X-ray
tube which produces X-RAYS in the desired range. It is primarily used for
quantitating BONE MINERAL CONTENT, especially for the diagnosis of OSTEOPOROSIS,
and also in measuring BONE MINERALIZATION.

1: Bone Density  
The amount of mineral per square centimeter of BONE. This is the definition used
in clinical practice. Actual bone density would be expressed in grams per
milliliter. It is most frequently measured by X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY or
TOMOGRAPHY, X RAY COMPUTED. Bone density is an important predictor for
OSTEOPOROSIS.

1: Bone Remodeling  
The continuous turnover of bone matrix and mineral that involves first, an
increase in resorption (osteoclastic activity) and later, reactive bone
formation (osteoblastic activity). The process of bone remodeling takes place in
the adult skeleton at discrete foci. The process ensures the mechanical
integrity of the skeleton throughout life and plays an important role in calcium
homeostasis. An imbalance in the regulation of bone remodeling's two contrasting
events, bone resorption and bone formation, results in many of the metabolic
bone diseases, such as OSTEOPOROSIS.

1: Insulin-Like Growth Factor I  
A well-characterized basic peptide believed to be secreted by the liver and to
circulate in the blood. It has growth-regulating, insulin-like, and mitogenic
activities. This growth factor has a major, but not absolute, dependence on
GROWTH HORMONE. It is believed to be mainly active in adults in contrast to
INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR II, which is a major fetal growth factor.
